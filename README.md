# AI_Challenge
This project is part of the Digital Product School (DPS) AI Engineering Challenge. The task was to build a machine learning model that forecasts monthly traffic accidents involving alcohol in Munich, based on historical data.

**Problem Statement**

1. Using the publicly available dataset "Monatszahlen Verkehrsunfälle" from the München Open Data Portal.

2. Forecast the number of alcohol-related traffic accidents (Category: Alkoholunfälle, Type: insgesamt) for January 2021.

3. Visualize the historical data and show the model's prediction.

4. Publish the model and expose it as a REST API endpoint that accepts a JSON input with a year and month and returns a forecasted accident count.
